<p>As neurologists, our physicians are highly trained to treat disorders of the nervous system, which include diseases of the brain, spinal cord, nerves, and muscles. Some common problems that neurologists diagnose and treat are strokes, epilepsy (seizures), headaches, dementias (Alzheimer's disease), multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and various forms of pain. Neurologists may serve as consultants to other physicians and may provide long-term care to patients with chronic neurological disorders.</p>

<p>Our medical staff includes the following physicians:
